# The double integrator in LQG and active inference
This problem represents the simplest single-degree-of-freedom translational and rotational motion, a vasty simplified version of a mass-spring model.

This example was used to show in a very simple set up the differences in implementation of a method based on the separation principle of control theory, i.e. LQG [1], [2], and a method not using this explicit set of assumptions, i.e. active inference [3], [4].
The implications were first explained in [5], suggesting that the LQG approach fundamentally inspiring most of the work in psychology and neuroscience may present some intrinsic limitations. Active inference is then proposed as an alternative. A more complete version version of this manuscript is near completion.
